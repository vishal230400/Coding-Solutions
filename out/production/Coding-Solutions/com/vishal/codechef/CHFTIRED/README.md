# Question Code : CHFTIRED

Oh, these difficult contests… In each contest, there are so many hard tasks Chef cannot solve. However, he knows that he can only become a successful coder if he works hard. Fortunately, he has a problem in mind for training.

You are given two positive integers a and b. You may apply the following magical operation any number of times (including zero):

choose an arbitrary positive integer d
perform exactly one of the following actions:
add d to a, add d−1 to b
add d−1 to a, add d to b
Chef is asking you to find out if it is possible to obtain a=b. Help him!
