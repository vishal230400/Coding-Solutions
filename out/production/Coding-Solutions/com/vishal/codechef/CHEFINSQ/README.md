# Question Code : CHEFINSQ

Chef has a sequence A1,A2,â€¦,AN. This sequence has exactly 2N subsequences. Chef considers a subsequence of A interesting if its size is exactly K and the sum of all its elements is minimum possible, i.e. there is no subsequence with size K which has a smaller sum.

Help Chef find the number of interesting subsequences of the sequence A.
