# Question Code : XXOORR

Given an array A1,A2…AN, find the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) required to convert all integers in A to 0.

In one operation, you

choose a non-negative integer p (p≥0),
select at most  K  indices in the array A, and
for each selected index i, replace Ai with Ai⊕2p. Here, ⊕ denotes bitwise XOR.
