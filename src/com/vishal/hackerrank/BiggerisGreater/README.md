# Question Name : BiggerisGreater

Lexicographical order is often known as alphabetical order when dealing with strings. A string is greater than another string if it comes later in a lexicographically sorted list.

Given a word, create a new word by swapping some or all of its characters. This new word must meet two criteria:

It must be greater than the original word
It must be the smallest word that meets the first condition
