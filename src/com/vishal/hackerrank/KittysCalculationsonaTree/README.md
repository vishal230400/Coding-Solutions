where:

 denotes an unordered pair of nodes belonging to the set.
 denotes the number of edges on the unique (shortest) path between nodes  and .
Given  and  sets of  distinct nodes, calculate the expression for each set. For each set of nodes, print the value of the expression modulo  on a new line.
