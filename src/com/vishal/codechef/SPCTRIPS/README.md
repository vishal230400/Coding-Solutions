# Question Code : SPCTRIPS

Gintoki has been very lazy recently and he hasn't made enough money to pay the rent this month. So the old landlady has given him a problem to solve instead, if he can solve this problem the rent will be waived. The problem is as follows:

A triplet of integers (A,B,C) is considered to be special if it satisfies the following properties for a given integer N :

AmodB=C
BmodC=0
1≤A,B,C≤N
Example: There are three special triplets for N=3.

(1,3,1) is a special triplet, since (1mod3)=1 and (3mod1)=0.
(1,2,1) is a special triplet, since (1mod2)=1 and  (2mod1)=0 .
(3,2,1) is a special triplet, since (3mod2)=1 and (2mod1)=0.
The landlady gives Gintoki an integer N. Now Gintoki needs to find the number of special triplets. Can you help him to find the answer?
