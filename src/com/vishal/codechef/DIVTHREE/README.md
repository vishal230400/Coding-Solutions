# Question Code : DIVTHREE

Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has N setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The ith setter has made Ai problems where 1≤i≤N.

A Division-3 contest should have exactly K problems. Chef wants to plan for the next D days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.

Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these D days?
